For camera control, use asdw rt fg io
The smooth movement is done by using unity's old input system's gravity and sensitivity properties

The  camera rotation is done with the Animator as a state machine.
Alternatively, it could be made by using trigonometric functions to calculate camera's position around a point, then using Transform.Lookat() to rotate the camera towards the center
